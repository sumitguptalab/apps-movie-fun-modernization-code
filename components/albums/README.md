# Albums Component!

## To start with Kotlin, edit the build.gradle file in the albums component. Add the kotlin plugin, the kotlin-spring plugin, and add a dependency on the Kotlin standard library

##IntelliJ has a convenient action that converts a Java file to Kotlin. It works pretty well, but there are usually a few changes necessary after conversion. Open the AlbumsController in the albums component, then perform the Convert Java File to Kotlin File action (Cmd + Alt + Shift + K on MacOS, Ctrl + Alt + Shift + K on Windows)
